I wrote all aligners in JAVA.


1. Run:
There are four JAVA souce code files. The arguments are passed by args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3], args[4], args[5]. The first
two arguments are path to FASTA files in String type, the others are int type scores. 

a. If running the programs under Eclipse. set the args[] under run -> Run Configuration -> Arguments.
For example. If you want to run Global_Algner with two FASTA file a.txt and b.txt uner diretory ~/your_machine/ and match score 1,
mismatch and indels for -1. Then pass to argument field: 

~/your_machine/a.txt ~/your_machine/b.txt 1 -1 -1 

The result include marix, optimal score and aligned sequences.

b. If running the programs under Windows, first compile the source file using javac, then run the class file using java.
For example, If you want to run Global_Algner with two FASTA file a.txt and b.txt uner diretory ~/your_machine/ and match score 1,
mismatch and indels for -1. Then run the following command under command line.

> javac Global_Aligner.java
> java Global_Algner ~/your_machine/a.txt ~/your_machine/b.txt 1 -1 -1


2. Design:
The implementation of the compute matrix algorithm is all followed the algrithm in book, assignment and wikipedia. For traceback and print:
 a. Global Alignment: start from the last corner to the first corner.
 b. Local Alignment: start from the highest score cell until the cell score greater than 0.
 c. Fitting Alignment: start from the highest score cell in the last row and traceback until the shorter sequence finished. 
 d. Global Alignment with AGP: I finshed the filling(algorithm) the matrix part. trying to debug why there is a infinite loop in 
 traceback. but it doesnt work properply.
 e. Human-mouse Orthology: Most part is from the code in fitting alignment, I returned the aligned seqences into a list so that
  I could get in main to process.New stuff is parsing the two files, now if the line contains ">" then jump through this line end
  with a newline,then put the info below it together. so e.g in mouse.fa we have a array with 5 strings. String[0] only contains a 
  "\n". I calculate the sequence identity directly in main. If two fitting sequences have same character, then put it into a new 
  String. at last compute the ratio.
  
  
3. Flaws:
  a. For global, local, fitting alignment. the each file only could contain one legal FASTA epression like  
mouse.fa
>chr5:38,212,668-38,212,766
CGGCAACATGGGTTTCGCGGCCATCTTCAGCTTCTCCAGCTCCGCCTCCTGCAGTCTCTT

human.fa
>chr5:29,766,392-29,766,522
GGTAAAGAAGTTTGATGCTATCTATAGAGATGGAGGTGAGGGGAAAGAACTGGACAACCT
CTTTACCATGATTGCCCATTTGTACAACTTCCACGTGGTACAGTCTATCCTCATCTTTGA
CATTTTAAAGA
Because I only simply skip first line of the file to get the sequences.

b. I try to elimate all possible bugs to generate the correct answer for any possible sequences. I have found some and fixed 
them. But I am not sure if there is still more.

c. For fitting and last program. its better to put shorter sequence in first argument and longer in second one. I tested with
short sequences and put either shorter or longer in first and the other in second. It is working. but I am not sure for long 
sequences.

d. Affine Gap penalty program doesn't work properly.
